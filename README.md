# Program3

Implement a class PhoneNumberTest that uses jUnit 4 to run unit tests from a static main method. The tests should exhaustively 
cover all public methods of class PhoneNumber from Program 2, including the static ones.

To properly test your unit tests, run them against your class PhoneNumber from Program 2. After setting up jUnit, you can run 
them on the command line using syntax like the following:

 $ java -cp .:junit-4.12.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar PhoneNumberTest 
 
Note that you'll need to have already compiled your class PhoneNumber and class PhoneNumberTest in your IDE (or on the command line 
with javac) for this to work. Follow the "getting started" instructions on the jUnit website to get up and running.

As part of this assignment, fix any issues in your class PhoneNumber from Program 2 for credit. 
Your fixed PhoneNumber should pass all of my unit tests, as well as yours. Moreover, your PhoneNumberTest should correctly test any 
other implementation of PhoneNumber that adheres to the original UML specification provided in the previous assignment. 
Note, however, that both the tests (your PhoneNumberTest with jUnit unit tests) and the test target (your fixed PhoneNumber)
are part of the deliverable; therefore you may not share test code for this assignment.

Submit a single .zip file containing only your (fixed) PhoneNumber.java and PhoneNumberTest.java source files on FoxTALE. 
Starting with this assignment, submissions that are not delivered in the proper format will receive zero points.
